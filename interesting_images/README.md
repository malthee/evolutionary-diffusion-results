# Interesting Image Results across all Experiments
The following are results that I picked across all Experiments which I have found interesting.

## Island GA with Aesthetics
Experiment of combining random prompt embeddings with weighted artist embeddings. Images come from different generations of the algorithm. 

The results show a diverse range of images, escaping the artist's style and creating something new.
