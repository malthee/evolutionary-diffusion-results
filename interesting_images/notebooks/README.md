# Island Notebooks
This folder is dedicated to the notebooks that were used to run the Island GA experiments. The notebooks are organized by the type of experiment that was run. 

### General Findings
* It is better to not have strong selection pressure or else styles that are "weaker" in aesthetics will be erased quickly
* A score around 5-6 is desirable for good quality, but not too biased results
* Islands should have a big enough population to maintain diversity and style, experiments have shown at least around 10 individuals

## Artists on Islands

## Epochs on Islands

## Artist Works on Islands


## Others
Also tried a mix of the experiments above, like epochs with specifics artworks on an islands, or artists from epochs grouped together, but that seemed to lead to style erasure, a common problem when only few examples of a style are in the population.
