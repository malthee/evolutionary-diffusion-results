# Island Notebooks
This folder is dedicated to the notebooks that were used to run the Island GA experiments. The notebooks are organized by the type of experiment that was run. 

### General Findings
* It is better to not have strong selection pressure or else styles that are "weaker" in aesthetics will be erased quickly
* An aesthetics score around 5-6 is desirable for good quality, but not too biased results
* Islands should have a big enough population to maintain diversity and style, experiments have shown at least around 10 individuals
* Island topology makes a difference, when random styles are overpowered quickly, neighboring styles in ring topology are less likely to get disturbed
* All in all this produced a wide variety of artwork
