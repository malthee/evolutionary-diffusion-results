# Island Notebooks
This folder is dedicated to the notebooks that were used to run the Island GA experiments. The notebooks are organized by the type of experiment that was run. The following are the types of experiments that were run:

## Artists on Islands

## Epochs on Islands

## Artist Works on Islands


## Others
Also tried a mix of the experiments above, like epochs with specifics artworks on an islands, or artists from epochs grouped together, but that seemed to lead to style erasure, a common problem when only few examples of a style are in the population.
